#Project 3
### Hypothesis: If we can create a program that analyzes the conversion rate inefficiencies among the cryptocurrencies listed on the Coinbase Pro exchange then we can find alpha through the automatic identification and speedy execution of a trading algorithm.
- We will use Purchasing Power Parity as our main determining factor to identify arbitrage opportunities within the altcoin listings the Coinbase exchange
- To pull in live crypto trading data we will utilize Coinbase Developer and their API
- Once data feed is established we will clean and analyze the data to identify actionable price inefficiencies among the exchange rates the listed coins
- We will then create a trading algorithm that will generate trade signals as well as determine when to execute a buy or sell, or to hold the assets
- Once we have set up the trading bot we will connect it to the Ethereum platform utilizing solidity handle the transfer of any assets between cold wallets or hot exchange wallets
